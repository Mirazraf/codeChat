# Privacy Settings User Guide

## Overview

CodeChat gives you complete control over your profile visibility. You can choose what information to share with other users through our flexible privacy system that works at both global and field levels.

## Understanding Privacy Levels

### Global Profile Visibility

Your **Global Visibility** setting acts as a master switch for your entire profile:

- **🔐 Private (Default)**: Your profile is hidden from other users. Only your username, role, and avatar are visible.
- **🌐 Public**: Your profile respects individual field privacy settings. Other users can see fields you've marked as public.

**Important**: When global visibility is set to private, all your profile information is hidden regardless of individual field settings.

### Field-Level Privacy

Each profile field has its own privacy control:

- **🔒 Private**: The field is hidden from other users
- **🔓 Public**: The field is visible to other users (only when global visibility is public)

## Profile Fields

Here's what each privacy setting controls:

| Field | Description | Default Setting |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Full Name** | Your complete name | Private |
| **Email** | Your email address | Private |
| **Phone Number** | Your contact number | Private |
| **Gender** | Your gender identity | Private |
| **Date of Birth** | Your birthday | Private |
| **Blood Group** | Your blood type | Private |
| **Location** | Your city/country | Private |
| **Bio** | Your personal description | Public |
| **Avatar** | Your profile picture | Public |
| **Social Links** | Links to your social media | Private |
| **Student Info** | Academic information (for students) | Private |
| **Teacher Info** | Teaching information (for teachers) | Private |

```

**Result**: Only your username, role, and avatar are visible. Perfect for users who value complete privacy.

## Best Practices

### 🛡️ Security Recommendations

1. **Keep sensitive information private**: Email, phone number, and date of birth should generally remain private
2. **Review regularly**: Check your privacy settings periodically to ensure they match your preferences
3. **Start private**: New users start with maximum privacy. Only make fields public when you're comfortable
4. **Professional boundaries**: Teachers should maintain appropriate privacy boundaries with students

### 💡 Tips for Effective Privacy Management

- **Use global visibility for quick changes**: Toggle to private when you need a break from visibility
- **Customize per field**: Don't feel obligated to make everything public or private—mix and match
- **Update as needed**: Your privacy needs may change over time—adjust settings accordingly
- **Check before sharing**: Review what's public before participating in public discussions

## Viewing Other Users' Profiles

When you view another user's profile:

- If their **global visibility is private**: You'll only see username, role, and avatar
- If their **global visibility is public**: You'll see fields they've marked as public
- **Your own profile**: You always see all your fields with privacy indicators
